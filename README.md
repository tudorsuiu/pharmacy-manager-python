<h2>‚ÑπÔ∏è About</h2>
This is a program designed to manage a virtual pharmacy. The program allows for the creation, editing, and deletion of medication, client card, and transaction information.
The program also includes a search functionality that allows users to search for medications and clients using full-text search. Additionally, the program can export all transactions within a given time interval and display the medication and client cards in descending order of sales and discounts, respectively.
The program permits the deletion of all transactions that occurred within a particular period of time and the percentage-based rise in price of all prescription drugs with prices below a specified threshold.

<h2>üß† Key learnings</h2>

- <strong>Object-Oriented Programming:</strong> <i>I learned how to use OOP for the creation of modular, reusable code that is easier to maintain and understand.</i>
- <strong>Three-Layer Architecture:</strong> <i>Using this concept I learned how to provide a structured way of organizing software systems into three layers: presentation, logic and data storage. This concept improves code maintainability, scalability and separation of concerns.</i>
- <strong>Data validation:</strong> <i>To avoid unpleasant situations in which data is entered that does not comply with certain conditions, for example, the CNP should not contain letters, we will validate the data before entering it into the system.</i>
- <strong>JSON files:</strong> <i>Using this type of files, I understood better how different systems transfer data between them. Any system that uses this format for saving/reading data will be able to handle them without any problem.</i>
- <strong>Readabilty of code:</strong> <i>Readable code is easier to understand, maintain, and debug. Proper indentation, naming conventions, and code comments can improve code readability.</i>
- <strong>GIT:</strong> <i>I learned some basic commands to be able to collaborate with my professors and colleagues at the university.</i>
