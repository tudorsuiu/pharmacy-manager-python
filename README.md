<h2>ℹ️ About</h2>
This is a program designed to manage a virtual pharmacy. The program allows for the creation, editing, and deletion of medication, client card, and transaction information.
The program also includes a search functionality that allows users to search for medications and clients using full-text search. Additionally, the program can export all transactions within a given time interval and display the medication and client cards in descending order of sales and discounts, respectively.
The program permits the deletion of all transactions that occurred within a particular period of time and the percentage-based rise in price of all prescription drugs with prices below a specified threshold.

<h2>🛠️ Functionalities</h2>

<h2>🧠 Key learnings</h2>

- <strong>Database:</strong> <i>I learned how to connect to a PostgreSQL database and how to use it in my application.</i>
- <strong>Design patterns:</strong> <i>I understood better the concept of "Design patterns" and why it should be implemented in any application.</i>
- <strong>GUI with JavaFX:</strong> <i>I learned how to link the logical part of the program and the part of the graphic interface with which the user interacts by using JavaFX.</i>
- <strong>Readability of code:</strong> <i>Writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain is essential for ensuring code quality and improving developer productivity.</i>

<h2>📈 Project status</h2>
The project is <strong>nearly finished</strong>. The chat feature is the only thing left to implement. I'm considering the following implementation of this feature: The connected user will select a different user from his friends list and click the "Send message" button to start a chat between them in a new window.
