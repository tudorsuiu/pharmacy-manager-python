<h2>ℹ️ About</h2>
This is a program designed to manage a virtual pharmacy. The program allows for the creation, editing, and deletion of medication, client card, and transaction information.
The program also includes a search functionality that allows users to search for medications and clients using full-text search. Additionally, the program can export all transactions within a given time interval and display the medication and client cards in descending order of sales and discounts, respectively.
The program permits the deletion of all transactions that occurred within a particular period of time and the percentage-based rise in price of all prescription drugs with prices below a specified threshold.
